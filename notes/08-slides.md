A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $â€“q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though?

*Tutorial follow-up*:

Does the charge $\sigma$ on the beam line affect the particles being accelerated inside it?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

*Think: Why? Or why not?*

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* There's no field inside

*Tutorial follow-up*:

Could the charge $\sigma$ affect the electronic equipment outside the tunnel?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

*Think: Why? Or why not?*

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Definitely a field outside
