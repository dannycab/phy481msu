An infinite solenoid with surface current density $K$ is oriented along the $z$-axis. To use Ampere's Law, we need to argue what we think $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})$ depends on and which way it points.

For this solenoid, $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})=$

1. $B(z)\,\hat{z}$
2. $B(z)\,\hat{\phi}$
3. $B(s)\,\hat{z}$
4. $B(s)\,\hat{\phi}$
5. Something else?

An infinite solenoid with surface current density $K$ is oriented along the $z$-axis. Apply Ampere's Law to the rectangular imaginary loop in the $yz$ plane shown.  What does this tell you about $B_z$, the $z$-component of the B-field outside the solenoid?

1. $B_z$ is constant outside
2. $B_z$ is zero outside
3. $B_z$ is not constant outside
4. It tells you nothing about $B_z$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

An infinite solenoid with surface current density $K$ is oriented along the $z$-axis. Apply Ampere's Law to the rectangular imaginary loop in the $yz$ plane shown. We can safely assume that $B(s\rightarrow\infty)=0$. What does this tell you about the B-field outside the solenoid?

1. $|\mathbf{B}|$ is a small non-zero constant outside
2. $|\mathbf{B}|$ is zero outside
3. $|\mathbf{B}|$ is not constant outside
4. We still don't know anything about $|\mathbf{B}|$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
