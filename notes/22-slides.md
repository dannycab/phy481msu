Consider a single point charge at the origin. It will have ONLY a monopole contribution to the potential at a location $\mathbf{r} = \langle x,y,z\rangle$.

As we have seen, if we move the charge to another location (e.g., $\mathbf{r}' = \langle 0,0,d \rangle$), the distribution now has a dipole contribution to the potential at $\mathbf{r}$!

What the hell is going on here?

1. It's just how the math works out. Nothing has changed physically at $\mathbf{r}$.
2. There is something different about the field at $\mathbf{r}$ and the potential is showing us that.
3. I'm not sure how to resolve this problem.

A stationary point charge $+Q$ is near a block of polarization material (a linear dielectric).  The net electrostatic force on the block due to the point charge is:

1. attractive (to the left)
2. repulsive (to the right)
3. zero
