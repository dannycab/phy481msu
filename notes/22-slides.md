Consider a single point charge at the origin. It will have ONLY a monopole contribution to the potential at a location $\mathbf{r} = \langle x,y,z\rangle$.

As we have seen, if we move the charge to another location (e.g., $\mathbf{r}' = \langle 0,0,d \rangle$), the distribution now has a dipole contribution to the potential at $\mathbf{r}$!

What the hell is going on here?

1. It's just how the math works out. Nothing has changed physically at $\mathbf{r}$.
2. There is something different about the field at $\mathbf{r}$ and the potential is showing us that.
3. I'm not sure how to resolve this problem.

A VERY thin slab of thickness $d$ and area $A$ has volume charge density $\rho = Q / V$. Because it's so thin, we may think of it as a surface charge density $\sigma = Q / A$.

<img src="./images/thin_slab_polarization.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/>


The relation between $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is:
1. $\sigma = \rho$
2. $\sigma = \rho d$		
3. $\sigma = \rho/d$
4. $\sigma = V \rho$		
5. $\sigma = \rho/V$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

If we push this conductor inside the isolated capacitor, will it be drawn into the capacitor or repelled?

<img src="./images/cap_metal_insert.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


1. It gets sucked into the capacitor
2. It gets pushed out from the capacitor
3. I just don’t know.
