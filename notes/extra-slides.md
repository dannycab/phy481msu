Griffiths argues that the force on a dipole in an E field is:  $\mathbf{F} = \left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{E}$

If the dipole $\mathbf{p}$ points in the $z$ direction, what direction is the force?

1. Also in the $z$ direction
2. perpendicular to $z$
3. it could point in any direction

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

Griffiths argues that the force on a dipole in an E field is:  $\mathbf{F} = \left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{E}$

If the dipole p points in the z direction, what can you say about E if I tell you the force is in the x direction?

1. $\mathbf{E}$ simply points in the $x$ direction
2. $E_z$ must depend on $x$
3. $E_z$ must depend on $z$
4. $E_x$ must depend on $x$
5. $E_x$ must depend on $z$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E

Are $\rho_b$ and $\sigma_b$ due to real charges?

1. Of course not! They are as fictitious as it gets!
2. Of course they are!  They are as real as it gets!
3. I have no idea

If we push this conductor inside the isolated capacitor, will it be drawn into the capacitor or repelled?

<img src="./images/cap_metal_insert.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


1. It gets sucked into the capacitor
2. It gets pushed out from the capacitor
3. I just don’t know.

An  ideal (large) capacitor has charge $Q$. A neutral linear dielectric is inserted into the gap (with given dielectric constant)
Now that we have $\mathbf{D}$ in the dielectric, what is $\mathbf{E}$ in that **small gap** above the dielectric?



1. $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{D} \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r$
2. $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{D}/\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r$
3. $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{D} \varepsilon_0$
4. $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{D}/\varepsilon_0$
5. Not so simple! Need another method

* CORRECT ANSWER: D

An  ideal (large) capacitor has charge $Q$. A neutral linear dielectric is inserted into the gap (with given dielectric constant). Where is $\mathbf{E}$ discontinuous?

i) near the free charges on the plates

ii) near the bound charges on the dielectric surface

1. i only
2. ii only
3. both i and ii (but nowhere else)
4. both i and ii but also other places
5. none of these/something else
