Griffiths argues that the force on a dipole in an E field is:  $\mathbf{F} = \left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{E}$

If the dipole $\mathbf{p}$ points in the $z$ direction, what direction is the force?

1. Also in the $z$ direction
2. perpendicular to $z$
3. it could point in any direction

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

Griffiths argues that the force on a dipole in an E field is:  $\mathbf{F} = \left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{E}$

If the dipole p points in the z direction, what can you say about E if I tell you the force is in the x direction?

1. $\mathbf{E}$ simply points in the $x$ direction
2. $E_z$ must depend on $x$
3. $E_z$ must depend on $z$
4. $E_x$ must depend on $x$
5. $E_x$ must depend on $z$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
