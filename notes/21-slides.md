A VERY thin slab of thickness $d$ and area $A$ has volume charge density $\rho = Q / V$. Because it's so thin, we may think of it as a surface charge density $\sigma = Q / A$.

<img src="./images/thin_slab_polarization.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/>


The relation between $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is:
1. $\sigma = \rho$
2. $\sigma = \rho d$		
3. $\sigma = \rho/d$
4. $\sigma = V \rho$		
5. $\sigma = \rho/V$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
