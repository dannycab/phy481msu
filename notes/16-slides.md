Suppose $V_1(r)$ and $V_2(r)$ are linearly independent functions which both solve Laplace's equation, $\nabla^2 V = 0$.

Does $aV_1(r)+bV_2(r)$ also solve it (with $a$ and $b$ constants)?

1. Yes. The Laplacian is a linear operator
2. No. The uniqueness theorem says this scenario is impossible, there are never two independent solutions!
3. It is a definite yes or no, but the reasons given above just aren't right!
4. It depends...


Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
