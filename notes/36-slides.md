What is the physical interpretation of $\oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$?

1. The current density $\mathbf{J}$
2. The magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$
3. The magnetic flux $\Phi_B$
4. It's none of the above, but is something simple and concrete
5. It has no particular physical interpretation at all

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

Consider a square loop enclosing some amount of magnetic field lines with height $H$ and length $L$.
We intend to compute $\Phi_B = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$? What happens to $\Phi_B$ as $H$ becomes vanishingly small?

1. $\Phi_B$ stays constant
2. $\Phi_B$ gets smaller but doesn't vanish
3. $\Phi_B \rightarrow 0$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

Consider a square loop enclosing some amount of magnetic field lines with height $H$ and length $L$. If $\Phi_B \rightarrow 0$ as $H \rightarrow 0$ (or $L \rightarrow 0$), what does that say about the continuity of $\mathbf{A}$?

$\Phi_B = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$

1. $\mathbf{A}$ is continuous at boundaries
2. $\mathbf{A}$ is discontinuous at boundaries
3. ???
