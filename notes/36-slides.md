What is the physical interpretation of $\oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$?

1. The current density $\mathbf{J}$
2. The magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$
3. The magnetic flux $\Phi_B$
4. It's none of the above, but is something simple and concrete
5. It has no particular physical interpretation at all

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

Consider a square loop enclosing some amount of magnetic field lines with height $H$ and length $L$.
We intend to compute $\Phi_B = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$? What happens to $\Phi_B$ as $H$ becomes vanishingly small?

1. $\Phi_B$ stays constant
2. $\Phi_B$ gets smaller but doesn't vanish
3. $\Phi_B \rightarrow 0$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

Consider a square loop enclosing some amount of magnetic field lines with height $H$ and length $L$. If $\Phi_B \rightarrow 0$ as $H \rightarrow 0$ (or $L \rightarrow 0$), what does that say about the continuity of $\mathbf{A}$?

$\Phi_B = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$

1. $\mathbf{A}$ is continuous at boundaries
2. $\mathbf{A}$ is discontinuous at boundaries
3. ???

The force on a segment of wire $L$ is $\mathbf{F} = I \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}$

A current-carrying wire loop is in a constant magnetic field $\mathbf{B} = B \hat{z}$ as shown. What is the direction of the torque on the loop?

1. Zero
2. +x		
3. +y		
4. +z
5. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

The torque on a magnetic dipole in a B field is:  

$\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}$

How will a small current loop line up if the B field points uniformly up the page?
