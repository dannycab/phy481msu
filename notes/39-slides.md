Predict the results of the following experiment: a paramagnetic bar and a diamagnetic bar are pushed inside of a solenoid.


1. The paramagnet is pushed out, the diamagnet is sucked in
2. The diamagnet is pushed out, the paramagnet is sucked in
3. Both are sucked in, but with different force
4. Both are pushed out, but with different force

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

A very long aluminum (paramagnetic!) rod carries a uniformly distributed current $I$ along the $+z$ direction.
What is the direction of the bound volume current?

1. $\mathbf{J}_B$ points parallel to $I$
2. $\mathbf{J}_B$ points anti-parallel to $I$
3. It’s zero!
4. Other/not sure

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

A very long aluminum (paramagnetic!) rod carries a uniformly distributed current $I$ along the $+z$ direction. We know $\mathbf{B}$ will be CCW as viewed from above. (Right?) What about $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ inside the cylinder?

<img src="./images/Al_rod_example_B_shown.png" align="right" style="width: 250px";/>


1. Both are CCW
2. Both are CW
3. $\mathbf{H}$ is CCW, but $\mathbf{M}$ is CW
4. $\mathbf{H}$ is CW, $\mathbf{M}$ is CCW
5. ???
