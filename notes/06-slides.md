The space in and around a cubical box (edge length $L$) is filled with a constant uniform electric field, $\mathbf{E} = E_0 \hat{y}$. What is the TOTAL electric flux $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ through this closed surface?

1. 0
2. $E_0L^2$
3. $2E_0L^2$
4. $6E_0L^2$
5. We don't know $\rho(r)$, so can't answer.

**Activity:** For a the electric field of a point charge, $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$, compute $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}$.

*Hint: The front fly leaf of Griffiths suggests that the we take:*
$$\dfrac{1}{r^2}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\dfrac{\partial E_r}{\partial r}\right)$$

What is the value of:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 \delta(x-2)dx$$

1. 0
2. 2
3. 4
4. $\infty$
5. Something else

**Activity**: Compute the following integrals. Note anything special you had to do.

* Row 1-2: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} xe^x \delta(x-1)dx$
* Row 3-4: $\int_{\infty}^{-\infty} \log(x) \delta(x-2)dx$
* Row 5-6: $\int_{-\infty}^{0} xe^x \delta(x-1)dx$
* Row 6+: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x+1)^2 \delta(4x)dx$

A point charge ($q$) is located at position $\mathbf{R}$, as shown. What is $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, the charge density in all space?  

<img src ="./images/pt_charge_at_R.png" align="right" style="width: 300px";/>


1. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{R})$
2. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{r})$
3. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{r})$
4. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})$
5. Something else??

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $–q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero everywhere on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero…
