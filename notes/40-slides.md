## What's on the final exam?

* A few true/false questions about $\mathbf{B}$, $\mathbf{H}$, and Ampere's Law
* Determine bound charge, $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{D}$ for some material ($\mathbf{P}$), and explain how quantities might change
* Determine and explain the direction of the force between two dipoles in some configuration
* Determine the $\mathbf{B}$ for some $\mathbf{J}$ and, by analogy, find $\mathbf{A}$ given some $\mathbf{B}$
* Determine bound currents, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathbf{H}$ for some material with a "simple" free current, and explain properties of the bound currents
* **3 Bonus questions:**
  * Give advice to future 481 students, tell us what was challenging for you, and a physics question
