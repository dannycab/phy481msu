A proton ($q=+e$) is released from rest in a uniform $\mathbf{E}$ and uniform $\mathbf{B}$.  $\mathbf{E}$ points up, $\mathbf{B}$ points into the page.  Which of the paths will the proton initially follow?

A + charged particle moving up (speed $v$) enters a region with uniform $\mathbf{B}$ (left) and uniform $\mathbf{E}$ (into page). What's the direction of $\mathbf{F}_{net}$ on the particle, at the instant it enters the region?

<img src="./images/charge_enters_EandB.png" align="right" style="width: 400px";/>


1. To the left
2. Into the page
3. Out of the page
4. No net force
5. Not enough information

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* The forces point in opposite directions, but not sure of their size

A proton (speed $v$) enters a region of uniform $\mathbf{B}$. $v$ makes an angle $\theta$ with $\mathbf{B}$. What is the subsequent path of the proton?

1. Helical
2. Straight line
3. Circular motion, $\perp$ to page. (plane of circle is $\perp$ to $\mathbf{B}$)
4. Circular motion, $\perp$ to page. (plane of circle at angle $\theta$ w.r.t. $\mathbf{B}$)
5. Impossible.  $\mathbf{v}$ should always be $\perp$ to $\mathbf{B}$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
