1. Zero
2. $-q$
3. $+q$
4. $0 < q_{outer} < +q$
5. $-q < q_{outer} < 0$

A long coax has total charge $+Q$ on the OUTER conductor. The INNER conductor is neutral.

What is the sign of the potential difference, $\Delta V = V(c)-V(0)$, between the center of the inner conductor ($s = 0$)
and the outside of the outer conductor?

1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Zero

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
