# Homework 1 (Due September 9th)

Homework 1 emphasizes the mathematical formalism and thinking that you will draw on in much of the work in this class. It focuses on Sections 1.1-1.4 of Griffiths. It also serves as an introduction to using [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org), which we will use on most homework assignments in this class. With regard to computation, you will be using the [sympy](http://sympy.org) library, which allows you to perform symbolic manipulations (like Mathematica), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library, which helps you plot different kinds of figures. For this homework, there are several videos that you can draw on (referenced below) to help you.
