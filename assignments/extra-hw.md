## 2. Bound charges and the D-field

Consider a long teflon rod, (a dielectric cylinder), radius $a$. Imagine that we could somehow set up a permanent polarization $\mathbf{P}(s,\phi,z) = k\mathbf{s} ( = ks\hat{s})$, where $s$ is the usual cylindrical radial vector from the $z$-axis, and $k$ is a constant). Neglect end effects, the cylinder is long.

1. Calculate the bound charges $\sigma_{bound}$ (on the outer surface) and $\rho_{bound}$ (in the interior of the rod). What are the units of your constant $k$? Show that the units work out in all formulas you have used involving $k$.
2. Next, use these bound charges (along with Gauss' law, this problem has very high symmetry!) to find the electric field, $\mathbf{E}$ inside and outside the cylinder. (Your answer should include both the direction and magnitude.)
3. Finally, determine the electric displacement field ($\mathbf{D}$) inside and outside the cylinder using the fundamental definition ($\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}$) and verify that "Gauss’ law for D-fields" works out. Explain briefly in words why your answers are what they are.

## 3. Bound charges and the D-field II

Now let's hollow out that teflon rod, so it has inner radius $b$, and outer radius is (still) $a$. Just to make things a little different here, suppose we now set up a different polarization within the teflon material, namely $\mathbf{P}(s,\phi,z) = k\hat{s}$ for $b<s<a$ and where $k$ is a given constant.


1. We have vacuum for $s<b$ and $s>a$. What does that tell you about $\mathbf{P}$ in those regions? Find the bound charges $\sigma_{bound}$ (on inner and outer surfaces of the hollow rod) and $\rho_{bound}$ (everywhere else).
2. Use these bound charges, along with Gauss' law, to find the electric field, $\mathbf{E}$, everywhere in space. (Your answer should include the direction and magnitude.)
3. Use Gauss' Law for D-fields to find $\mathbf{D}$ everywhere in space. *This should be quick – use symmetry! Are there any free charges in this problem?* Use this (simple) result for $\mathbf{D}$ along with $\mathbf{D}=\varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P}$ to find $\mathbf{E}$ everywhere in space. (This should serve as a check for part 1, and shows why sometimes thinking about D-fields is easier and faster!)
